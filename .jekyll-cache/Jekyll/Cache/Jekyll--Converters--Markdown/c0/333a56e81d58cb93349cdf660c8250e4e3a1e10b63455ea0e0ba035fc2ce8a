I"ì<p>The overall goal of this blog is to document my learning experiences, ranging from music to coding to just pretty much whatever I find interesting.</p>

<p>Setting up this website wasnâ€™t too difficult thanks to the ease of use of Github pages and the availability of the jenkyll-now repo that served great as a boilerplate template. Right now, Iâ€™ll probably look into making this website look better first, then Iâ€™ll actually get into writing the blogs later down the line. Cya.</p>
