<p>5 days ago marked the official end of my IB diploma (at least all the work that I will need to do to receive my diploma) and also hopefully started a wonderful summer. Since this is most likely the last summer of which I will have no internships, work or big exams to study for, it means this will likely be the last summer that I can do whatever the fuck I want.</p>

<p>SO, in order to make this summer productive, I’m going to write a list down now of things that I want to do before September where first year of university starts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Re-run <a href="https://www.instagram.com/superficial.visuals/">@superficial.visuals</a> with Winston my dear friend. Instead of having a theme or whatever, I plan to just dump what I enjoy and also use it as a place for my digital-art.</li>
  <li>Learn how to use Blender to create 3D art. I personally really enjoy art that look realistic but clearly defy the laws of Physics.</li>
  <li>Code at least 2 side projects. I already know what I want to do, but I will release the details later when I am more comfortable :)</li>
  <li>Write an EP. Been talking about this forever now — this summer’s gotta be the one where it finally happens.</li>
  <li>Nail and record with my jazz band at a studio again.</li>
  <li>Get fit again lol.</li>
</ol>

<p>For now, those are my biggest priorities and I plan to use this blog to update my progress throughout summer.</p>

<h1 id="progress-mid-week-1-of-summer2021">Progress: Mid-Week 1 of Summer2021</h1>

<h2 id="photography--purchased-my-first-ever-professional-camera">Photography — purchased my first-ever professional camera</h2>

<p>I bought a new camera recently so I’ve been out taking a lot of photos, experimenting with this somewhat unfamiliar medium.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-html-and-css--learning-the-fundamentals">Javascript, HTML and CSS — learning the fundamentals</h2>

<p>Succesefully made my own private website (just locally hosted, so you guys won’t be able to see it). I hope to be able to create responsive websites using Bootstrap by the end of today and explore different JS animation scripts by the end of this week.</p>

<p>Though web design is not computer science so learning all of this would not help my CS degree next year, I still think its a useful skill to have. Besides, its another creative outlet that works nicely with my Photoshopping experience.</p>

<h2 id="blender--created-my-first-ever-piece-of-cg-art">Blender — created my first-ever piece of CG art</h2>

<p>Created my first ever piece of render art. I followed Blender Guru’s iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4">beginner CG donut tutorial</a> but got bored and don’t really care for the final outcome, so instead I found another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt-_Htl-R90">environment tutorial</a> which I ultimately edited into my first render artwork ever.</p>

<p>The thing with this new hobby as well, is that it reaffirmed my belief that Physics and maths is super important in anything digital. Whenever terms like “normal”, “focal length”, “fluid simulation” and “particle simulation” are mentioned briefly in tutorials, I am happy because I know that at least 10% of the time I spent studying was useful.</p>

<h2 id="overall--good-progress">Overall — good progress!</h2>

<p>This week was more focused on resting and not really trying to push through an insane amount of progress in my new ventures, so I am glad that I started a few of them off already and to a good start. Next week, I will commit harder. See ya.</p>
