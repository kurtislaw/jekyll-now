title: General goals and briefers
---

The overall goal of this blog is to document my learning experiences, ranging from music to coding to just pretty much whatever I find interesting. 

Setting up this website wasn't too difficult thanks to the ease of use of Github pages and the availability of the jenkyll-now repo that served great as a boilerplate template. Right now, I'll probably look into making this website look better first, then I'll actually get into writing the blogs later down the line. Cya.
