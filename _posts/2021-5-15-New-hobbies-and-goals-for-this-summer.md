# Goals for this summer

5 days ago marked the official end to my IB diploma (at least all the work that I had to do to receive my diploma) and also hopefully the start to a wonderful summer. Since this is most likely the last summer where I will have no internships, work or big exams to study for, it means that it will likely be the last summer where I can do whatever I want. 

SO, in order to make this summer more productive, I'm going to write down a list of things that I want to do before September, where first year of university starts.

1. Re-run [@superficial.visuals](https://www.instagram.com/superficial.visuals/) with Winston, a friend of mine. Instead of having a theme or whatever, I plan to just dump what I enjoy and also use it as a place for my digital-art.
2. Learn how to use Blender to create 3D art. I personally really enjoy art that look realistic but clearly defy the laws of Physics.
3. Code at least 2 side projects. I already know what I want to do, but I will release the details later when I am more comfortable :)
4. Write an EP. Been talking about this forever now — this summer's gotta be the one where it finally happens.
5. Nail and record with my jazz band at a studio again.
6. Get fit again lol.

For now, those are my biggest priorities and I plan to use this blog to update my progress throughout summer.

# Progress: Mid-Week 1 of Summer2021

## Photography — purchased my first-ever professional camera

I bought a new camera recently so I've been out taking a lot of photos, experimenting with this somewhat unfamiliar medium.

## Javascript, HTML and CSS — learning the fundamentals

Successfully made my own private website (just locally hosted though, so you guys won't be able to see it). I hope to be able to create responsive websites using Bootstrap by the end of today and explore different JS animation scripts by the end of this week. 

Though web design is not computer science, meaning learning all of this would not help my CS degree next year, I still think its a useful skill to have. Besides, its another creative outlet that works nicely with my Photoshopping experience. 

## Blender — created my first-ever piece of CG art

Created my first ever piece of render art. I followed Blender Guru's iconic [beginner CG donut tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4) (it even has its own [sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlenderDoughnuts/)) but got bored and don't really care for the final outcome, so instead I found another [environment tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt-_Htl-R90) which I ultimately edited into my first render artwork ever.

{% include image.html url="/assets/summer-goals/final-render.png" description="The final rendered image — for some reason, the background was not included in the render. I wasn't bothered to troubleshoot the issue." %}

The thing with this new hobby as well, is that it reaffirmed my belief that Physics and maths is super important in anything digital related. Whenever terms like "normal", "focal length", "fluid simulation" and "particle simulation" are mentioned briefly in tutorials, I become happy because I know that at least 10% of the time I spent studying is proving useful.

## Overall — good progress!

This week was more focused on resting and not really trying to push through an insane amount of progress in my new ventures, so I am glad that I started a few of them off already and to a good start. Next week, I will commit harder. See ya.
